               Having the option to add the book information, save the price, rate the book will allow you to 
               make sure you always know what to read next. Encouraging users to add as many books as they 
               would like to increase their range of book categories and to fuel their passion of reading.

            <p>
                I do not have any experience web design or web development. I began to learn JavaScript a while 
                ago but didn't continue since I figured it would be more beneficial to learn it in a class. Since 
                I have no experience, I hope to learn a lot in this class. I want to be able to work with web 
                applications after this semester and having even the most basic knowledge can help with that.

            <h2><u>Homework 1</u></h2>
            <p>
               There were a few challenges I had when completing this lab. I created an external style sheet 
               which was easy but figuring out how to reference it was a little difficult. Once I figured out how 
               to do that I understood it better. I also had problems with making the titleNav responsive. I had 
               the code to make it responsive, but having the proper padding was a bit confusing to get right. The tutorials and 
                examples that were provided were very useful for this assignment and helped me with a majority of 
                my problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The rest of the lab was relatively easy. Changing the text and colors were straight forward.
                Understanding all the id's was not difficult since they are named reasonably. Even including an 
                image as the background was easy since there were examples on how to do it. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This lab was very useful in general since it allow me to work with a lot of the basics of creating a 
                website. A lot of it was covered in the lab activity, but the additional requirements had helped me 
                understand the layout of the website a lot more.
