            <h1>Library Component</h1>


            <h2>What it is</h2>
            <p>
                The library component is a way of displaying a long list of books with authors names and being able to filter through them. Each individual book 
                can be clicked on display the rest of the component. The component itself contains a list that can be any length and displays each book one after another. 
                There is also a search bar to look for any book in the list. This is an efficient way to search through a long list of novels. This can also be used to 
                search for a specific author.

                Within the component there is a search bar, a list of clickable books. When a book is clicked, it displays a modal which includes a slideshow and a 
                zoom feature. When clicking on the images of the slideshow, the user will be able to zoom in a specific area of the image which can 
                be moved.    
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>How to use it</h2>

            <p>
                To use this component, the parameter has to contain an object with three required properties. The required properties includes:
            </p>
           
            <ul>
                <li>title: a string of the books name</li>
                <li>author: a string of the authors name</li>
                <li>images: an array of one or more images</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                If one of these properties is not included, the component will alert the user and will return early. The component returns a DOM 
                element which can be added to another page. Appending this element will display all elements included.
            </p>

            <h2>Code Snippets</h2>
            <h3>Slideshow</h3>
            <p>
                The slideshow is a combination of images that are all displayed at different times. The slideshow should be an element 
                that contains the img tags and some way to navigate through the images, in this case buttons. 

                When creating a slideshow, each image has an index starting at 1. The first thing that happens is each images display attribute 
                is set to 'none' so all the images don't show up. After the image at the current index has its display attribute set to 'block'. 
                When you navigate to another image the index changes by 1 and calls the function making all images hidden again. This makes sure that 
                only one image is shown at a time. In this example, there are two arrows to navigate through the images. 
                When creating the navigation actions, you can determine whether or not the image loops around or just stops the the end of 
                the slideshow. Either way you would set the index to the first element in the array or the last element. In this case it stops.
            </p>

            <h3>Filter</h3>
            <p>
                The filter feature is a single input element that allows the user to input any value. This feature depends on having another DOM element 
                that it can search through and filter.

                The way the search bar works is it takes an array of elements and looks at each individual elements inner text and the text content. It then compares 
                the users input to the text of the element. If the text is the same as the input, it will display the element as 'block' and if not the display attribute 
                will be 'none'. 

                When comparing the input and the text, you can keep it as case sensitive or, in this instance, you can make everything 
                upper case using 'toUpperCase'.
            </p>

            <h3>Zoom</h3>
            <p>
                The zoom feature allows the user to zoom in on most images, using an img tag. Using any image, the component generates another copy of the image 
                that is zoomed a certain value. Some images, depending on their size, will not generate a zoomed in image properly.
                
                When making the zoom feature, the zoomed image is zoomed in automatically, but can be set to display the zoom effect on a click. 
                The demo displays what it looks like when the overall div needs to be clicked and the snippet displays what it looks like without needing to be clicked.
                Every time the cursor moves, a new image is generated with the new zoomed in position. With each image being generated, it also determines the position of 
                where the image will be shown relative to the cursor.
            </p>
